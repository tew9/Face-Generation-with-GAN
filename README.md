# Face-Generation-with-GAN
**Face Generation Introduction In this project**: 
In this project we'll use generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces.  Processed CelebA face data.
Getting the project files The project files can be found in this public GitHub repo. 
You can download the files from here, but it's better to clone the repository to your computer. 
This way you can stay up to date with any changes we make by pulling the changes to your local repository with git pull.

I'm using convolutional GAN to build the descriminator and generator.
I'll be using descriminator so lonely to optimize the generator, so 
It can generate a better face.

I'll save the generated faces and display them after training.
